# AlgorithmAndDataStructurePrep
This repository will help you to study the main topics in algorithms and data structures with practice in 6-8 months

## Plan 
we will study one topic each week 
we will solve 2 problems a day around the topic 

## Steps to solve the problem 
1-first we read the problem and made sure we understand it 
2-we determine the edge cases and the contrains
3-we write the psudocode for the brute force solution 
4-we study the time and space complexity for the brute force solution 
5-give some plans how to optimize the code
6-bring the more optimized solution 
7-analyze the time complexity and space complexity of the new solution 
8-run some examples to make sure that the solution works 
9-run the application and resolve any issues 

## Some constrains during solving the problems
1-every problem should be solved within 30min - 1 hour 
2-you should solve the problem out side the code editor and you can only run the code at the final step
3-you should not copy and past codes
4-your code should at least beat 80% of leetcoder 
5-after you done with your solution read other solutions 
6-after you done with the problem read geeksforgeeks article around the topic 
7-you should at least solve 5 hard problem of the topic before moving to the next topic ,keep study the topic if you can not solve 5 hard problems
8-try to solve problem with two coding language
