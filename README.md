# AlgorithmAndDataStructurePrep
This repository will help you to study the main topics in algorithms and data structures with practice in 6-8 months

## Plan 
we will study one topic each week  <br>
we will solve 2 problems a day around the topic  <br>

## Steps to solve the problem  <br>
1-first we read the problem and made sure we understand it <br>
2-we determine the edge cases and the contrains <br>
3-we write the psudocode for the brute force solution  <br>
4-we study the time and space complexity for the brute force solution  <br>
5-give some plans how to optimize the code <br>
6-bring the more optimized solution  <br>
7-analyze the time complexity and space complexity of the new solution  <br>
8-run some examples to make sure that the solution works  <br>
9-run the application and resolve any issues  <br>

## Some constrains during solving the problems
1-every problem should be solved within 30min - 1 hour  <br>
2-you should solve the problem out side the code editor and you can only run the code at the final step <br>
3-you should not copy and past codes <br>
4-your code should at least beat 80% of leetcoder  <br>
5-after you done with your solution read other solutions  <br>
6-after you done with the problem read geeksforgeeks article around the topic  <br>
7-you should at least solve 5 hard problem of the topic before moving to the next topic ,keep study the topic if you can not solve 5 hard problems <br>
8-try to solve problem with two coding language <br>
